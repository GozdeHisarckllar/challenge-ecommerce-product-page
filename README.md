## My process

* I created and tried to use reusable custom components as much as possible, especially for the lightbox/gallery and navbar components.
* By creating a list of sample data objects, for some custom components, I tried to create a simulation of the case as if the data was fetched from an API and adjust the code in order to make it became more compatible to display more data of other possibly additional products. (ex. shopping cart updates, gallery/lightbox, when assumed React Routers and other product pages are created and made some necessary adjustments such as using map() for rendering as well).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 and JSX markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM methodology
- ES6 features
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Throughout the project, I faced some new challenges and learning oppotunities while coming up with possible solutions to some cases such as gallery/slider functionalities & animations, updating context of an inner object of a state variable. I really enjoyed the process of both learning and contemplating, finding out solutions and then testing my solutions with considering different possible cases. 

### Continued development

I am plannig to continue focusing on coding different types of gallery or slider designs. Also, I would like to create a project with additional product pages on the frontend and product data fetched from the backend.
